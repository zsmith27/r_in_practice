# Goals

1. To make you aware of the tools available to you.
    + __ggplot2__ for creating figures
    + __dplyr__ and __tidyr__ for data manipulation
    + __lubridate__ for handling and formatting dates
    + __rmarkdown__ for creating documents
    + __shiny__ for creating interactive apps
2. To provide you with the vocabulary and understanding of R syntax to...
    + Understand how to ask meaningful questions
    + Understand how to use functions
    + Interpret example code


R, like any other skill, is going to require you to invest a time to practice. I cannot help you with time management, but I can provide you with an 1) awareness of tools available and 2) the vocabulary and understanding of syntax to make practicing less frustrating.

## Tip

A good way to invest more time in R is to use R in situations where you would normally use MS Excel.
